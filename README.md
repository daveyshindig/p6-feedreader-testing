# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing: they'd already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and I was left with an application with an incomplete test suite. So I wrote tests that provide good coverage of the application core.


## How Does One Run This App?

1. From the terminal, clone the repository to your machine with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/daveywilkie/p6-feedreader-testing.git`.
2. In the project's top-level directory, open `index.html` with your favorite Internet browser.
3. The test suite will then run automatically, for your review.
